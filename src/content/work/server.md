  This website was a test for me. I tried to use next.js and NextAuth for the first time. The goal was to have a website that gives me infos on my server like memory usage, disk space and more. I was also wanted to add all my projects here to see them all online. I tried to add node to my server but somehow it failed.
support:
  - Next
  - React
  - Tailwind
