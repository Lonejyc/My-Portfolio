description: |
  This is a website I've done for my first real client, the association "Hydraulique Sans Frontière". For this website, I learned how to use Wordpress PHP functions cause that was a Wordpress website. I also learned few new things like Webpack and SCSS but also a bit of GSAP and the use of other external JS library like Flickity.
support:
  - PHP
  - SCSS
  - JS
